I hold a bachelor's degree in Linguistics and am currently pursuing a master's degree in Description, Analysis, and Processing of Natural Languages. Semantics is my main area of ​​expertise, and my work involves developing logical formalizations that capture the meaning of expressions in natural languages.

I use the Agda language to implement, in a proof system, the formalizations I develop during my work. My projects involve Lambda Calculus, Type-Logical Grammars, and resources for NLP.
